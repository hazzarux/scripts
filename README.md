SCRIPTS
=======
bash
----
The files in this folder are some of my simple bash scripts for automating purposes.

Nothing that's brilliant for the good of humanity. But some things for the good of my own laziness.

bashrc
-------
my personal .bashrc file

you should put this in your /home/ folder. (as .bashrc)

python
------
some scripts I've used back in the time.

again: for my own laziness.
