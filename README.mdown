SCRIPTS
=======
bash
----
The files in this folder are some of my simple bash scripts for automating purposes.
Nothing that's brilliant for the good of humanity. But some things for the good of my laziness.

bashrc
-------
my personal .bashrc file
you should put this in your /home/ folder. (as .bashrc)

        #todo
* have a look at pardus .bashrc file & update this one.
